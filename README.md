Made a desktop application for drawing using python and Tkinter GUI toolkit.
Used regression to correct human error while drawing i.e. to straighten lines and smooth out curves.
Used k-means clustering to detect corners and applied regression to smooth out shapes.
Used OOPs to develop a scalable way to add shapes to the application.
